KNOWN BUGS (if any):
For some reason Test 47 fails on the grading server as of 12/11/2016.  I had finished the code on Thursday (12/08/2016) and all 73 tests passed on the grading server.  I tried running it again today with the same commit (no edits) and it no longer works on the grading server, but it does work on my computer.  I checked with TF Mark and he thinks something went wrong with the grading server.  Hope there's not an issue with our code.  Thanks!


NOTES FOR THE GRADER (if any):
This is the regrade for pset5 per the regrade policy.
