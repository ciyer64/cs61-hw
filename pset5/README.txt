OTHER COLLABORATORS AND CITATIONS (if any):



KNOWN BUGS (if any):
For some reason Test 47 fails on the grading server as of 12/11/2016.  I had finished the code on Thursday (12/08/2016) and all 73 tests passed on the grading server.  I tried running it again today with the same commit (no edits) and it no longer works on the grading server, but it does work on my computer.


NOTES FOR THE GRADER (if any):
This is the regrade for pset5 per the regrade policy.
